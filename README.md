# The_Subway_Challenge

The [Subway Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Challenge) is a challenge for a participant to reach every station in the NYC subway network in as little time as possible. The fastest time someone was able to reach all 469 stations was set in [2016 by Matthew Ahn](https://ny.curbed.com/2016/8/29/12693812/nyc-subway-challenge-guinness-world-record) at a time of 21 hours and 28 minutes. Since then, [three new stations have opened](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/nyregion/second-avenue-subway-opening-upper-east-side-manhattan.html) (72nd Street, 86th Street and 96th Street) as part of the Second Avenue Subway extension. Technically, therefore, the Subway Challenge has yet to be completed for the current MTA system. And since Matthew Ahn has kept his route secret ([besides knowing the beginning and end of his route](https://ny.curbed.com/2016/8/29/12693812/nyc-subway-challenge-guinness-world-record)), one is left to wonder: what route should someone take to reach every station in the NYC subway system? Additionally, approximately how long would it take? Could the slightly-outdated record be broken, even with more stations to visit? 

## Description of Process
This project attempts to answer a seemingly simple question: what's the quickest way to visit all 472 NYC subway stations? The process to answering this question will go something like this:
1. **Gather data on expected train times for a specific period**: In other words, we'll consider a typical amount of time for a train route and then use that in our calculations.
2. **Build the NYC subway network**: Once we have the amount of time between each staiton (node) on our graph, we will treat the distance between each point (including any transfers) as the distance (weight) between nodes on this graph. 
3. **Run a [Graph Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal) Algorithm to find shortest "distance" to visit all nodes**: This is a well studied problem in computer science because of the challenge to limit the processing time needed to find the (near) optimal solution. 
4. **Run [Chinese Postman Problem](http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/intro-to-graph-optimization-solving-cpp/#cpp-solution) on all terminal nodes and compare the performance of each**: The Chinese Postman Problem attempts to find the quickest/least costly route to reach all edges of a graph. It starts and ends at a certain node
